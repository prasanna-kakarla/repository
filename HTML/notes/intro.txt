HTML started by Tim Berner's LEE(WWW founder) in 1989-1992. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Laguage.current version of html is html5.

In html, Everything is defined by tags. tags represent context and there are 2 types. open tag and  close tag
<tagname>--open tag
</tagname>-- close tag

whole html code will be between <html> and </html>
html contains 2 child tags.., head and <body>
        
In html comments are written as <!-- comment -->

3)headings: are used to specify important terms.There are six headings available in html. all are bold and differed by size.ex:h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6

4)paragraphs:  are by default font-size:16px and it represents normal paragraphs using p tag. 
        lorem,lorem20 are used to generate dummy text of 20 words 

5)anchor tag: 'a' tag is used to link one web page to another or to navigate from one web page to another

href: take the place from user and respond the result to anchor tag

 8)tags vs elements:
 tags are either open or close
 eg: <h1>---h1 open tag,</h1>--close tag
 <h1>abcd</h1>---- h1 element
 element ===> open tag + conent + close 

 self- closing tags or empty elements or void elements will not have any closing tag <br> </br> <img src="" alt="" />

        caption ----> heading/caption of the table 
        rowspan ----> combine rows 
        colspan -----> combine columns
