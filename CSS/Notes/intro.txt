css means cascading style style sheets.css is used for styling/design/layout of page
how do we connect css to html?
there are three ways
1.inline css: we can assign styling to certaiin elements in their own line called inline css
<p style="background-color:black;">hello world </p>
2.internal css: we can use style as a element in the headers end
<style>
p{ color:red; }
</style>
3.external css:we can write css as a seperate file and connect them through the link

<link rel="stylesheet" href="path">


basic selectors:
There are so many selectors, basic selectors are tagname,id ,class name

tagname:we can tagnames directly,it applies to all elements with that tagname 

classname:classnames are identified by classnames and these properties applies to all elements with specific class name

idname:id's are identified by # and these properties applied by only element that id

id > classname > tagname

inline > internal > external
